## Simpler Terminal Theme
After buying my new iMac, I loved the unix environment and stability. And what I love most is the terminal. So I worked on whole night to get a simple and nice looking theme for the terminal.

After the whole night and morning - I was glad with what I got for now. May be I'll do more tweak and testing in future. But I want keep track of things - so made kept this in github. Also if anyone likes - they can us it too.
