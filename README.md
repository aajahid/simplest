## Simplest Terminal Theme
After buying my new iMac, I loved the unix environment and stability. And what I love most is the terminal. So I worked to get a simple and nice looking theme for the terminal. 

After the whole night tweaking around - I finally designed my simplest terminal theme. May be I'll do more tweak and testing in future. But I want keep track of things - so made kept this in github. Also if anyone likes - they can us it too.
